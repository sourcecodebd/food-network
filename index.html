                <p>
                    If youâ€™re looking for the creamy mac and cheese of your childhood, this is it! Homemade Velveeta
                    cheese sauce with tender mac is what mac and cheese dreams are made of.

                    These days we have fancy mac and cheese with gruyere and breadcrumbs and all that, but do you ever
                    dream of just easy plain mac and cheese, like the box kind, but without the powdered cheese and that
                    mushy pasta? Enter this Velveeta mac and cheese.

                <h3 class="orange">Instant pot chicken breast, Korean style</h3>
                <p>
                    These chicken breasts are marinated in a sweet and spicy chili sauce thatâ€™s inspired by the BTS
                    sweet chili sauce. Iâ€™m a low-key ARMY so when I saw that Mcdonaldâ€™s themed up with BTS for a chicken
                    nuggget meal you bet I was there. I love nuggies! But most of all, I loved the sweet chili sauce!
                    Because I suspected it was a classic Korean sweet and spicy sauce used with Korean fried chicken, I
                    did a quick peep on the ingredients for the sweet chili sauce and it was almost exactly what youâ€™d
                    find in a Korean dakgangjeong sauce.

                <h3 class="orange">A crunchwrap supreme is the ultimate cheat day eat.</h3>
                <p>
                    Itâ€™s the best combination ever of crunchy and soft, savory and fresh. Itâ€™s basically a flattened
                    burrito with a crispy crunchy tostada core. Thereâ€™s seasoned beef, nacho cheese, a giant crunchy
                    corn chip, lettuce, tomatoes, and sour cream all tucked into a flour tortilla thatâ€™s grilled. Itâ€™s
                    SO GOOD.

                    Itâ€™s definitely one of my guilty pleasures. Making it at home makes it not-so-guilty because,
                    everythingâ€™s healthier when you make it at home, right? Even if you eat three of them?!
